# ESP32-S3 UART Register-Level Programming Example

This is an example of how to configure and use the UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) interface on the ESP32-S3 microcontroller using register-level programming. The code demonstrates UART initialization, transmission, and reception, and it continuously sends and receives data.

## Introduction

This example showcases how to configure and use the UART interface on the ESP32-S3 at a low level, bypassing the higher-level UART driver provided by the ESP-IDF. It sets up the UART to transmit and receive data and continuously sends and receives messages.

## Getting Started

To run this example, follow these steps:

1. Set up the ESP-IDF development environment by following the official [ESP-IDF documentation](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/).

2. Clone this repository to your local development environment:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nikhil-robinson/esp-idf-register-level.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd esp-idf-register-level/examples/uart
   ```

4. Build and flash the code to your ESP32-S3 development board using the ESP-IDF build tools.

5. Watch the serial output to observe the continuous transmission and reception of UART data.
