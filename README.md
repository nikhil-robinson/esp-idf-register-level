# ESP32-S3 Low-Level Register Coding Examples

This GitHub repository contains a collection of low-level register coding examples for the ESP32-S3 microcontroller. These examples demonstrate how to interact directly with the hardware registers of the ESP32-S3 to perform various tasks, such as configuring GPIO pins, setting up timers, and controlling peripherals.

## Introduction

The ESP32-S3 is a highly integrated, low-power, and secure Wi-Fi and Bluetooth SoC (System on Chip) designed for a wide range of IoT applications. While the Espressif IDF (IoT Development Framework) provides a high-level API for developing applications on the ESP32-S3, sometimes you may need to access hardware registers directly for fine-grained control or to implement specific functionality.

This repository serves as a resource for ESP32-S3 developers looking to work with low-level hardware registers. Each example demonstrates how to perform a particular task by configuring the relevant registers.

## Getting Started

To get started with these examples, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local development environment:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nikhil-robinson/esp-idf-register-level.git
   ```

2. Set up the ESP-IDF development environment according to the official [ESP-IDF documentation](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/).

3. Navigate to the specific example directory you're interested in.

4. Follow the README or code comments in that directory to understand how the low-level register coding is used to achieve a specific task.

## Examples

Here are some examples of tasks covered in this repository:

1. [GPIO Configuration](./examples/gpio) - Demonstrates how to configure GPIO pins for input or output.

2. [UART Communication](./examples/uart) - Illustrates low-level UART communication using registers.

Please explore the `examples` directory for more low-level coding examples.

## Documentation

For detailed information on the ESP32-S3's hardware registers and how to use them, refer to the official Technical Reference Manual (TRM):

[ESP32-S3 Technical Reference Manual](https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32s3_technical_reference_manual_en.pdf)

This manual provides in-depth information about the ESP32-S3's architecture, peripherals, and register descriptions.
